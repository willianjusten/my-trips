## NextJs na Prática

This project is part of a course called [NextJS na Prática](https://nextjs.willianjusten.com.br/), if you want to learn how to do it, this is the way.

## Getting Started

### GraphCMS

This project uses [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/), so you need to create an account there first.

After you need to create the Schema, just follow the steps:

- Schema > Add New Model with `Place` name
- And add the following fields:
  - `Single Line Text` as `name`
  - `Slug` as `slug`
  - `Map` as `location`
  - `Rich Text` as `description`
  - `Asset Picker` as `gallery`

- Schema > Add New Model with `Page` name
- And add the following fields:
  - `Single Line Text` as `heading`
  - `Slug` as `slug`
  - `Rich Text` as `body`

After that, fill some values and don't forget to `publish`!

#### Authentication

In order to create a token access, go to `Settings > API Access`, inside this page, find `Permanent Auth Tokens`,
create a Token Name and mark all queries possible. Save and get the token.

### NextJS

After creating your account on [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) and following the steps above, you just need to rename
the `.env.example` to `.env.local` (if you plan to run locally) and edit the keys there.

With all set, you can start the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Commands

- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
- `storybook`: runs storybook on `localhost:6006`
- `build-storybook`: create the build version of storybook

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
